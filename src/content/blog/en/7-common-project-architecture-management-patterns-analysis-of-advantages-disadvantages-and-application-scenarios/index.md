## Mono-repo Single Management Architecture

- All packages, libraries, or sub-projects are in the same version-controlled Repo.
- Each package or sub-project is in a different subdirectory of the repository. These subdirectories are independent of each other but share the - same parent directory.
- These sub-projects share the same configuration files, tools, scripts, etc., so the release cycle and process are consistent.
- Because they are in the same Repo, version control can be unified.

## Multi-repo (Polyrepo) Distributed Management Architecture

- Each sub-project is stored in a different version-controlled Repo.
- Individual projects have their own dependency management, version control, development process, and release cycle.
- Dependencies between projects are handled using package management tools, referencing other projects or packages through version numbers.
- This architecture is suitable for projects with strong independence and different release cycles.

## Microservices Architecture

- Split into multiple small, independent services, each with its own code deployment and scaling capabilities, fast startup, and technological diversity.
- Usually organized around functions or different business capabilities, typically using APIs for mutual communication.
- This project architecture is suitable for complex and constantly evolving project architectures, with considerable flexibility and scalability.
- The disadvantages are also quite obvious: deployment and data consistency management are difficult.

## Modular Monolith Management Architecture

- Modular monolithic architecture is a compromise between Monorepo and Polyrepo. It plans the application into multiple independent modules but still deploys a single application.
- The modular monolith pattern provides a certain degree of decoupling while avoiding the complexity of management like microservices architecture. Interaction efficiency between modules is higher.
- The dependencies between modules are stronger, and scaling still requires considering the overall application.

## Plugin Architecture

- The plugin architecture is divided into a core system and multiple plugin modules. Through the basic functions and extension points of the core system, it interacts with and extends the plugin modules.
- Suitable for highly customizable applications, such as browsers, editors, or development tools, which can promote the participation of third-party developers.

## Layered Architecture

- Layered management architecture is divided into multiple layers, each with a predetermined responsibility. The focus of each layer is separated, making the system easier to maintain.
- Usually divided into the presentation layer (usually the user interface), business logic layer, and data access layer.
- Each layer has clear and unique responsibilities, and each layer only interacts with the adjacent layers through these clear definitions.
- Layered architecture tends to be overly tight, easily affecting the flexibility of the entire system.
