## Line LIFF

### What's Line LIFFÔºü

Line LIFF is Line Front-end Framework, a front-end framework launched by Line platform. You can think of LIFF App as a completely independent website, except that we can interact with Line users through the JavaScript SDK launched by Line.

Opening through Line LIFF Browser.

### Why do we need to use LIFF?

With the SDK provided by Line LIFF, we can achieve the following:

- Obtain basic information of Line users. Including unique ID, display name, profile picture, and other basic information.
- Obtain device information of Line users. It can determine whether the user is using Line to open this device, thereby confirming their login status.
- When we can obtain the login status and Line user information, we can naturally allow users to skip the login step.

## Implementing a Line LIFF APP

### Importing Line LIFF into the project

You can import it via CDN or through NPM to import the [LIFF SDK](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/cli-tool-create-liff-app/#create-a-dev-env-using-liff-app)„ÄÇ

```html html
<script charset="utf-8" src="https://static.line-scdn.net/liff/edge/versions/2.22.3/sdk.js"></script>
```

```bash shell
$ npm install --save @line/liff
```

If you are building a LIFF APP from scratch, you can use the following command to start a new project. Personally, I prefer this method as it feels the fastest.

Create a LIFF App project.

```bash shell
$ npx @line/create-liff-app
```

Choose the framework technology you need:

```bash shell
? Which template do you want to use? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ vanilla
  react
  vue
  svelte
  nextjs
  nuxtjs
```

Confirm the language you want to use:

```bash shell
? JavaScript or TypeScript? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ JavaScript
  TypeScript
```

Enter the LIFF ID. You can skip this for now and change the environment variable later:

```bash shell
? Please enter your LIFF ID:
Don't you have LIFF ID? Check out https://developers.line.biz/ja/docs/liff/getting-started/ (liffId)
```

Choose your package management tool:

```bash
? Which package manager do you want to use? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ yarn
npm
```

DoneÔºÅ

```bash
yarn install v1.22.19

Done! Now run:

  cd my-app
  yarn dev
```

### Deploy the project

As we mentioned earlier, a LIFF App is a completely independent website, so we need to deploy it on a public site first. Here, I recommend [Zeabur](http://zeabur.com/), a service team from a Taiwanese startup company with 24/7 customer service, and the documentation is in Traditional Chinese, which is truly moving.

I have used Heroku before and currently also use Netlify and Render. They are all very convenient, but Zeabur is literally "one-click deployment".

After logging in, click "Create Project" and "Deploy New Service".


![zeabur-deploy-step1.png](zeabur-deploy-step1.png)

Click on Git, and it will ask for authorization. Select the Repo where you store your LIFF App. After updates, push to Github, and Zeabur will directly update for you.

![zeabur-deploy-step2.png](zeabur-deploy-step2.png)

The interface is really nice. Click on "Network" at the bottom.

![zeabur-deploy-step3.png](zeabur-deploy-step3.png)

Expand and click on Generate Domain. Choose a name that you find easy to remember. If there are no conflicts, the deployment can be completed, which is really fast.

### Create Line Developer Provider

Next, go to the [Line Developer Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/) page, add a Provider, and add a channel. LIFF is currently only available for Login and Mini App, but Mini App is not yet enabled in Taiwan, so choose Login.

![line-dev-setting-01.png](line-dev-setting-01.png)

Here, you fill in the basic information. Pay attention to Channel Icon, Name, and Description, as users will see these when using LIFF.

![line-dev-setting-02.png](line-dev-setting-02.png)

After creation, select the LIFF menu to fill in the information.

![line-dev-setting-03.png](line-dev-setting-03.png)

Note:

- Size: There are options for full screen, half, and 1/3.
- If you want to obtain user information: Check profile and openid.
- **Endpoint URL: Fill in the URL where you deployed on Zeabur.**
- **Module mode: You can minimize the LIFF App.**

![liff-size.png](liff-size.png)

Then you get the LIFF URL and ID.

![line-dev-setting-04.png](line-dev-setting-04.png)

Then go back to the project, replace the VITE_LIFF_ID in `.env` with the ID, and add environment variables on Zeabur.

If you see the following screen, it means the connection is successful. You need to re-deploy on Zeabur after entering the environment variables for it to take effect.
